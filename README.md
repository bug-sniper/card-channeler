# card-channeler
A Slay the Spire mod that allows you to channel cards into your orb slots. Channeled cards are unaffected by focus and have no passive effect. When they are evoked, the card is played for free; the casting cost is paid instead when the card is channeled.

Special thanks to:

* eternal0 and Gremious for the starting points
* Bug Kiooeht and the other basemod developers for all the patch apis
* Chronomancer for the small card rendering code
* All the people in the Slay The Spire modding discord for answering my questions

To do:

* Handle longer card names
* Make channel key configurable

Feel free to reuse parts of this mod in other mods.
